# Satisfactory Interactive Map - Key Technical Knowledge

## Global
- The map is built using Svelte and Vite
- The map is deployed to GitHub Pages
- Create a CHANGELOG.md file and document changes in it
- Read the README.md file for more information

## Map Data Structure
- The map uses a JSON-to-JS optimized structure stored in `src/data/resources.js`
- Resources are organized in categories → subcategories → resources
- Each resource has an ID, name, markers, and styling properties

## Icon System
- Icons are loaded from an atlas image at `public/assets/icon-atlas.png`
- Icons should be combined with colored circles for better visibility
- Original zoom settings for the map are: minZoom: -10, maxZoom: -4, initialZoom: -8

## Map Features
- Leaflet.js with Simple CRS for the Satisfactory coordinate system
- Markers should show detailed popups when clicked including the name, purity, coordinates, and id of the node
- Color circles around icons improve visibility
- Dont use MarkerCluster plugin

## CSS and Styling
- Resource markers use `:global()` CSS for Leaflet compatibility
- Colors for nodes follow Satisfactory's color scheme (orange/dark)
- Marker styling includes `border-color` for outline

## Build and Deploy
- GitHub Actions handles CI/CD with special permissions for GitHub Pages
- Base URL handling needed for proper asset loading on GitHub Pages
- Vite bundling with `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` used to reference assets

## Sidebar
- Sidebar shows structured resource nodes with counts and icons also loaded from the icon-atlas
- Uses reactive filtering to handle search and toggle states
- Each resource has a count of nodes displayed next to the name
